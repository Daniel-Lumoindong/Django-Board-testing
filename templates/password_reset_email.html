Hi there, 

Someone asked a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
Follow the link below:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case you forgot your Django Board username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy paste the URL in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this email in error, it is likely that another user entered your email address 
by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to 
take any further action and can safely disregard this email.

Thanks,
THe Django Boards Team
